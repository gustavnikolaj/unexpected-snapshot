This module has been deprecated. See the replacement here:

https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected-snapshot

This module exposes unexpected assertions for jest snapshots. It is written 
for jest version 20 and haven't seen much use since being published. If you
think it could be useful, please reach out to me and I can re-release it
under a new name or hand over the code so that you can do it yourself.
